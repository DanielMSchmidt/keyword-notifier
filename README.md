# keyword-notifier

Very much a learning project with no intention to be used in production.

I want to make requests to

- Twitter
- Stackoverflow
- Reddit

and find all mentions of my projects keywords.

A digest of this will be sent to my email. The intention is to run as a cron and only include each item once.
